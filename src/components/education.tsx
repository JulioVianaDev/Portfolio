                I completed an MBA in FullCycle Software Architecture, receiving training from instructors working at
                top tech companies like MongoDB, Google, Meta, Ita√∫, and Mercado Livre. The program covered advanced
                technologies such as Golang, Next.js, NestJS, RabbitMQ, DDD, Event-Driven Architecture, Hexagonal
                Architecture, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Microservices, and Design Systems. I also gained expertise in
                working with both relational and non-relational databases. The focus was on performance optimization,
                cost reduction, scalability, and building resilient systems. Additionally, I mastered observability
                tools like Grafana, Datadog, and New Relic for real-time tracing and analytics to drive data-driven
                decision-making.
